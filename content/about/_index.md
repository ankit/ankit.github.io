# Hi, I'm Ankit.

I like doing creative projects including photography, building software and origami.

I [previously](/leaving-coursera) worked at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). Now, I am living nomadically, reading and building fun projects.

I am the creator of [Stylebot](https://stylebot.dev/), a browser extension that lets you modify the appearance of any webpage. In graduate school, I built a personal information manager inside the web browser for my [Master's thesis](/thesis).

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/ankit/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ahujaankit) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hwked/). Or say hi at [ahuja.ankit@gmail.com](mailto:ahuja.ankit@gmail.com)
